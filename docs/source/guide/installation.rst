Installation
============

It is recommended that you install via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
or `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_, so you can simply
use::

    pip install vindinium

or::

    easy_install vindinium

For manual installation, first you will need `python-requests 
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest>_`. After that, move the 
``vindinium`` folder to your project directory.


Testing installation
--------------------

To verify if you installed vindinium correctly, open a console (or cmd) and 
type ``python`` to open the python interpreter, then do::

    >>> import vindinium
